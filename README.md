# Slope Stability Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation and Bayesian Inference

This repository contains the Python code and data used for slope stability analysis in a specified study area. It includes Monte Carlo simulations, regression analysis, OAT (One-At-a-Time) and multivariate sensitivity analyses, and Bayesian inference. The project is built entirely in a Python environment using real-world data.

## ðŸ“Œ Study Area
The case study is located in a rocky mountainous region with slope data and rock discontinuity parameters recorded from field surveys.
